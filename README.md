# Django templates

Create a new movie application with a database model with name, yearReleased, ageAllowed, and genre attributes.

Create a base html file with a header and footer. 

Use that base.html file to extend the index, and aboutpages. 

Make sure each page is called by a different named route and use no hardcoded-references to URLs
